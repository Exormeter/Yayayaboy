Crudely made Gameboy emulator that plays TetrisÂ®

Yayayaboy (Yet Another Yet Another Yet Another)

Just a fun sideproject to see how a simple emulator is build.
Plays Tetris and Super Mario Land, what more do you need?

One other aspect I wanted to investigate in this project is how I could translate the hardware of the Gameboy
into an Object-oriented design. While not perfect, I think the source code ended up quite readable.

So if you are currently build your own emulator and are look through other projects to find that missing piece, feel
free to look around.
